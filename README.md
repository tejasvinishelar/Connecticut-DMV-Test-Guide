	After taking reviews from several people, I observed that most of the CT DMV applications are not in sync with the DMV official 	manual. The questions and quiz in these present applications are not exactly covering all the points from the CT DMV Manual. Our App will majorly focus on creating the quiz questions and solutions directly from the official manual which will make it more realistic and dynamic for the users to give them a real test experience. MCQ preparation is the easiest preparation technique instead of reading the entire DMV manual, so we will try to create maximum number of MCQ questions which will cover the maximum important points from the manual so that just referring the application will be enough and studying will be fun.
